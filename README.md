# UCI-AirPollution-Models
Predicting air quality trends using machine learning models on the UCI AirQuality dataset  Comparison of Linear Regression, XGBoost, and MLP models for UCI AirQuality time series data 
## ðŸ“– Overview

This project explores air quality patterns using the [UCI AirQuality dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/air+quality).  
It focuses on predicting air pollution levels based on environmental factors and compares the performance of different regression models.

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI AirQuality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/air+quality)  
- **Description:** Contains hourly averaged responses from an array of gas sensors deployed in an Italian city.  
- **Features:**  Date	, Time	, PT08.S1(CO) ,	NMHC(GT)	, C6H6(GT)	, PT08.S2(NMHC) ,	NOx(GT)	, PT08.S3(NOx) , 	PT08.S4(NO2),	PT08.S5(O3)	,T	,RH	,AH	,Unnamed: 15,	Unnamed: 16 
- **Target:** Predict air pollution (e.g., COGT & NO2GT)

## âš™ Methods
The following regression models were applied and compared:
1. **Linear Regression (LR)** â€“ Baseline model for prediction.
2. **XGBoost (XGB)** â€“ Gradient boosting regression for capturing non-linear patterns.
3. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** â€“ Neural network model for complex relationships.

**Evaluation Metrics:**  
- RÂ² Score  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## ðŸ“Š Results
- The notebook contains visualizations comparing model predictions vs actual values.  
- Performance metrics are calculated for all three models to determine the best-performing approach.
